When a spendthrift squanders his capital it is lost to him and his heirs; yet it goes somewhere else. When a nation allows any one kind of natural resource to be squandered it must suffer a real, positive loss; yet substitutes of another kind can generally be found. But when wildlife is squandered it does not go elsewhere, like squandered money; it cannot possibly be replaced by any substitute, as some inorganic resources are: it is simply an absolute, dead loss, gone beyond even the hope of recall.\r\nFrom the context, the word ‘venial’ in paragraph two most nearly means', 'Reading_Comprehension', 'Difficult', 'trivial', 'major', 'criminal', 'frequent'),
